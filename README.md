You will need to acquire a [Google Maps Api](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) key to use this software. Insert your key on line 38.

Flight predictions compatible with this software come from [CUSF Landing Predictor 2.5](http://predict.habhub.org/). Download the KML file to use with this software.

For reviews, download the archived data from the BOREALIS lab Iridium tracking website, or use a log file generated by the antenna tracking and RFD controls GUI.

After selecting a file, use the map tab to select a ground station location. The graphs will populate automatically.
