# Ground-Station-Prediction-and-Review
### by Austin Langford

You will need to acquire a [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) key to use this software. Put your key into the file api_key.

Flight predictions compatible with this software come from [CUSF Landing Predictor 2.5](http://predict.habhub.org/). Download the KML file to use with this software.

For reviews, download the archived data from the [BOREALIS lab Iridium tracking website](http://153.90.202.26), or use a log file generated by the antenna tracking and RFD controls GUI.

After selecting a file, use the map tab to select a ground station location. The graphs will populate automatically.

Use the Look for Good Locations button to have the software determine recommended locations based on distance. You can tweak what is considered a "good location" in the runAnalysis method of the Analyzer class. Enter a search resolution in the box to control how many locations are checked. More locations will take more time. The searching can be interrupted by pressing the button again.
