# Ground-Station-Prediction-and-Review
### by Austin Langford

Flight predictions compatible with this software come from [CUSF Landing Predictor 2.5](http://predict.habhub.org/).

This software takes either a flight prediction or a csv list of flight data.

After selecting a file, use the map tab to select a ground station location. The graphs will populate automatically.
