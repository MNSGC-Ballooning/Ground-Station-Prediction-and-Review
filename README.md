# Ground-Station-Prediction-and-Review
## by Austin Langford

Flight predictions compatible with this software come from [CUSF Landing Predictor 2.5](http://predict.habhub.org/).

This software takes either a flight prediction or a csv list of flight data, as well as a ground station location. 
It will then calculate and plot the bearing, elevation angle, and line of sight distance to the prediction or review 
from the chosen ground station location.
